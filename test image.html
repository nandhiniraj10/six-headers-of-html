<p style=color:red;>A pen is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing.[1] Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity which had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell.<sup>[2][3]</sup> Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized uses, such as in illustration and calligraphy.</style></p>
